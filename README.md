🎬 Netflix Clone
This is a Netflix homepage clone built using HTML and CSS.
It is a front-end-only project, created as a part of my learning journey in web development.



📌 About the Project
Created a static clone of the Netflix landing page

Used HTML for page structure

Applied CSS for styling and layout

Designed to look similar to the original Netflix homepage

Fully responsive for different screen sizes (if you added responsiveness)




🧑‍🎓 Student Info
I am currently a Diploma student in [Your Branch], and this is one of my early front-end practice projects.
I built this clone to improve my skills in HTML and CSS, and to understand how real websites are structured.
